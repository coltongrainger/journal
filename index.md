Following <https://issarice.wordpress.com/>, <https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes>, and Philip Guo <https://youtu.be/M2pGiBrw-Ns?t=422> I'm starting a working journal. I haven't gotten permission to emulate any one of them, so I'm sort of freeing myself to write in a manner that oscillates between their styles. In fact, beyond the common kernel of "daily updates/notes/entries" I feel each of these three authors is writing with a motive tangential to the other two: either for transparency, or for exploration, or for reflection. (Correct me if I'm wrong! I don't know!) Here's a quote (or three) from each that informs my belief.

> Realizing that I love to be alone, like in a physically low-stimulation environment, but I still think of myself as socially oriented even in that context. I still like texting/FaceTiming friends. And: I only want to be alone to work on ideas that I eventually take back to others. Like, if I were just writing for the sake of writing and not publishing it out, I’d probably get pretty bored and antsy

> Amplification vs. exploration: Usually I say that I prefer writing to talks/interviews bc I can think better through writing over speaking. But I think another big reason is bc people often want you to talk about stuff you’ve already done, which is not that interesting to me. Whereas with blog posts, it’s my blog, I don’t really care if you read it or not, I’m just putting stuff out there and hopefully connecting with a few ppl who feel the same way. To me, writing is pushing to the edges, exploring the limits of my identity and what I’m comfortable sharing in public. Whereas any other form of communicating ideas feels performative: I’m rehashing things I already know, and that you know me for. Also why I had to get off Medium (bc it made blogging feel performative)

> The granularity of your medium (should!) positively correlate to how controversial your content is:
> 
> - Twitter = lighthearted, thoughtful stuff
> - Blog post = harder convos
> - Podcasts = really hard convos
> 
> It’s like adding fiber to your diet (make the content harder to consume) so you don’t eat sugar all the time

> anyways so when I started my postdoc I thought of this idea I don't know how I thought of it but I thought this idea that I would just keep a running diary of anything that I've encountered that to work-related that I felt like writing down. so it was very simple. I created a text file. this is my first one (reading it) this is really funny I'm just reading this. this is July 2013, my first month as a postdoc.

> > July 2013 I'm going to start a rough weekly work diary reflecting on my thoughts about life as a young academic. I need to focus more on how I feel rather than what I did since it's easy to later reconstruct what I did from other artifacts but it's hard to recreate old feelings. this diary is gonna be quite rough and I don't want to hold myself to a strict writing schedule. let's keep this fairly freeform and low-key.

> once again in parentheses I said: *focus on how I feel rather than just what I did*

Issa Rice ([a note on scope of updates](https://issarice.wordpress.com/2018/12/01/a-note-on-scope-of-updates/))

> As I stated at the beginning, this blog came about because I wanted to make available information about “what I’m up to” in cases where “what I’m up to” doesn’t naturally lead to public updates. So I think it’s not so important to record things on here when the same information can be obtained through other sources (i.e. my public activity on other websites).
> 
> However, I also want to have some kind of conceptual coherence about this blog. And since the overlap between “my activity that doesn’t naturally lead to public updates but where I would like to make public updates available” and “my AI safety learning” is nearly perfect, I think I will track the former by writing about the latter.
